# OctoAcme â€” Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. **Kickoff meeting** with stakeholders and delivery team
   - Led by: Project Manager
   - Attendees: All core team members, key stakeholders
   - Output: Shared understanding of project goals and constraints

2. **Requirements gathering and documentation**
   - Led by: Business Analyst (with Product Manager)
   - Output: Detailed requirements, user stories with acceptance criteria
   - Handoff: BA provides requirements to PdM for backlog prioritization

3. **Create prioritized backlog** with acceptance criteria
   - Led by: Product Manager
   - Collaborates with: BA, UX Designer, Tech Lead
   - Output: Prioritized, estimated backlog ready for sprint planning

4. **UX design and prototyping** (if applicable)
   - Led by: UX Designer
   - Collaborates with: Product Manager, BA, Developers
   - Output: Design specifications, wireframes, user flows
   - Handoff: Design specs provided to Developers before implementation

5. **Estimate scope** (T-shirt sizing or story points)
   - Led by: Tech Lead with Development team
   - Output: Effort estimates for planning purposes

6. **Define Definition of Done (DoD)**
   - Led by: QA Lead with input from PM, PdM, Developers
   - Output: Clear quality gates and acceptance criteria

7. **Identify dependencies and integration points**
   - Led by: Project Manager with Tech Lead
   - Output: Dependency map and integration timeline

8. **Create release plan and milestone map**
   - Led by: Release Manager (with PM, PdM)
   - Output: Release schedule, deployment windows, rollback plans
