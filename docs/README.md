## Project Lifecycle and Key Artifacts

OctoAcme follows a structured five-phase delivery lifecycle designed for iterative, customer-first development. Projects begin with **Initiation**, where teams validate business needs through a Project One-pager that defines the problem statement, success metrics, stakeholders, and high-level timeline. The **Planning** phase transforms approved initiatives into actionable backlogs with clear acceptance criteria, prioritized work items, and a Definition of Done. During **Execution**, teams build, test, and review increments using sprint-based iterations. The **Release & Deployment** phase ensures safe production rollouts with pre-deployment checklists, smoke tests, and rollback plans. Finally, **Retrospective & Close** captures learnings and action items to drive continuous improvement. Key artifacts maintained throughout include the Project Charter, Roadmap, Sprint Backlog, Risk Register, and Retrospective notes.

## Core Workflows and Development Practices

Teams use GitHub Projects boards with columns (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, Done) to track progress transparently. Pull requests are kept small (≤400 lines when possible) and must include issue links, acceptance criteria, and passing CI checks before requesting review. At least one approval is required before merging, following team-defined policies. Automated CI pipelines run unit tests, integration tests, security scanning, and linting on every PR. End-to-end smoke tests validate critical flows before releases. Teams maintain daily standups (15 minutes) focused on progress and blockers, weekly delivery syncs to review updates and flagged risks, and sprint demos at milestone completion. Velocity, burndown, and key metrics (errors, latency, usage) are tracked via dashboards to inform data-driven decisions.

## Roles, Communication, and Escalation

OctoAcme projects are led by a **Project Manager** (coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, and communications) and a **Product Manager** (defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, measures success). **Developers** implement features and collaborate on design and testability, while **QA/Testing** validates quality and acceptance criteria. **Stakeholders** provide input and approvals. Communication follows a structured cadence: weekly syncs between PM and Product Manager, twice-weekly standups for delivery teams, and monthly stakeholder updates. Escalation paths are tiered: team-level triage occurs in daily standups; the PM escalates to the Product Lead and dependent teams for cross-functional blockers; sponsor-level escalation handles business-impacting issues. Risks are tracked in a Risk Register with impact, likelihood, owner, and mitigation plans, reviewed and updated weekly.

## Quality Assurance, Release Management, and Continuous Improvement

Quality is embedded throughout the development process with unit tests for new logic, integration tests for cross-component interactions, and end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows. Security scanning runs automatically in CI. Release types (patch, minor, major) follow a standardized deployment checklist: all acceptance criteria met, passing CI/security scans, release notes drafted, smoke tests prepared, and rollback plans documented. Deployments first go to staging for validation, then to production with post-deploy verifications and stakeholder announcements. If issues arise, teams trigger incident response with defined rollback procedures and blameless post-incident retrospectives. After each sprint, release, or milestone, teams conduct structured retrospectives to identify what went well, what could improve, and define 2–3 prioritized action items with clear owners and due dates. These improvements are tracked in the backlog and reviewed in weekly PM syncs, fostering a culture of iterative learning and measurable impact.
