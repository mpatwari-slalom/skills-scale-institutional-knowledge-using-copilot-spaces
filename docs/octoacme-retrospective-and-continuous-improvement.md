# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)

## Running a Retrospective

- Project Manager (facilitator)
- Product Manager
- Developers
- QA Lead
- Release Manager (for release retrospectives)
- UX Designer (if design work was involved)
- Business Analyst (if requirements were significant)

### Format
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Rotate facilitators to get different perspectives
